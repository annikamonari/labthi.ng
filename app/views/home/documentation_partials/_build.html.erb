<div class='doc'>
The <b>build phase</b> involves the idea’s team building and subsequently, its prototype and business plan engineering. Here, the owner of the idea pitches the idea to the community and details the types of team members he would like as partners along with skills he hopes they can provide. Then, this team works together to help develop the idea into a minimum viable product (the core features of the product allowing it to be deployed, and no more). Users can write the idea’s description (its business model and specification for the prototype construction), write part of the business plan, design the frontend, or code/build the prototype. The team's contributions are rewarded with equity in the idea and an increase in their reputation points. Each user on Labthi.ng also has, on his profile, skill bars in each of the 4 key start-up development areas: idea planning, business plan writing, prototyping and designing/branding. Upon completing a part and gaining equity, your proficiency in each of these areas increases. You can then quote these skill bars as representations of your entrepreneurial skill building on your CV!
<br><br>
If you do not have prior experience writing business plans or building prototypes, it does not matter; for each part, we explain what its for, what is required, and how to structure it. We thus help you develop your skills in each of these 4 areas, and give you experience directly applying them to building and brainstorming start-ups of all kinds. <br>

<a class='anchor' id='teambuild'></a>
  <h3><strong>Team Building</strong></h3><br>
  Here we explain the first part of the build phase: putting together the team behind the start-up. As soon as the idea is promoted into phase 2, the owner of the idea is notified to write a brief (pitch) for the idea, which is explained in detail below. This will be the community's base understanding of the idea: the product, its business model and its future goals. The creator is then told to write a <b>proposal</b> for the community, inviting candidates to apply to be team members of hte idea. 
  <hr>
  <h4><strong>Writing a Proposal</strong></h4><br>
  The proposal should include information about the current team member(s); their work ethics and personality characteristics, along with a brief description of their skillsets. Furthermore, it should include a description about what needs to be built in phase 2: what the goals for the idea by the end of phase 2 are and in how long they hope to complete them, what the current team member(s) are interested in building, and what they hope future team members will be interested in building. Then, there should be a description of the type of work ethic and skillsets the team hopes the future partners will have. Remember to be professional but friendly; you want the community to want to work with you. Also, try to be detailed in your explanations of the idea, its goals, and the skills needed for its phase 2 development, so that the community knows exactly what they are applying for and how to apply.
  <hr>
  <h4><strong>Applying to be a Team Member</strong></h4><br>
  Once this proposal is written, if a user clicks on the <b>build</b> tab in the navbar, and then the <b>needs team members</b> tab in the secondary navbar, he will see the idea listed as one with an open proposal; e.g., one looking for team members. Once he clicks on the <b>team build</b> section of the idea, he can choose to <b>apply to be a team member</b> under the proposal. When applying, you must explain how your skills and personality match those of the current team members. Explain your interest in the idea; why you like it, why your experience or knowledge can be valuable to the team, and why they should choose you to be a partner. Remember, it helps to have contributed in the brainstorming phase of the idea, since the owner and other users will already be familiar with your thinking and interest in the idea. <br><br>
  Attached to your application will be a detailed list of your contributions in the <b>create</b> phase; the number of questions, answers and solutions you have contributed, along with your local reputation. Furthermore, your skill bars from your profile will be attached to show the current team your experience and activity on the site. Do not worry if you do not have skills above 50%: this will never negatively affect your chances of being chosen. Everyone has to start somewhere.
  <hr>
  <h4><strong>Selecting a Team Member - Accepting an Application</strong></h4><br>
  If you think a candidate is a suitable partner for the idea and can contribute well, you can <b>accept</b> his application. All of the team members will vote on whether or not the candidate should be accepted. If, after all team members have read the application, more than 50% of the team has accepted it, the candidate is added to the team. <hr>
  <h4><strong>Next Steps</strong></h4><br>
  Once enough team members have been accepted and the team agrees that together they cover all of the necessary skills needed to complete phase 2, they can start building the idea. Here, they can move onto the <b>build</b> tab and begin starting parts and building content. When a team member finishes a part, other team members can leave him tasks and extra bits of content to improve the quality of his work. Once the team members all vote to accept it, the part is completed, the user is awarded proficiency in the appropriate skill area along with equity in the idea. He can then move onto starting and completing a new part.
  <br><br>Team members will also have access to the <b>discussion</b> tab, where they can generally discuss anything, regardless of whether it relates to the idea, its building or the team itself. Furthermore, each part has a <b>discussion</b> tab for discussing anything relating to that specific part.<br><br>We will proceed to explain the parts, their designated equity amounts, and what each part is.<hr>

  <br>
  The plan component is the idea description: the backbone of the <b>build phase</b>. All users building other parts have viewing access to this component, because it is the plan for the minimum viable product and business model of the idea. When the idea transitions into the <b>build phase</b>, this is the first part that must be built.
  <br><br>
  The business plan component details the business model of the product; business-related goals, why they are attainable and the plan for reaching these goals. Here, it will also detail the process by which the team who purchases the idea in the buy phase should further develop the product, the business and the marketing plan by which they should go about building the brand image and can successfully target the customer segment. Excluding the executive summary, every part of the business plan is independent and can be written without referencing each other. The executive summary, however, will be locked until the other parts are completed, as it consists of an in depth summary of each of the other business plan parts.
  <br><br>
  The design component regards the brand image of the product and the front end of the prototype. Users here will design the logo, the wireframes for the product (the page layouts for each page necessary to present the core functionality of the product), and the mock-ups for these wireframes (wireframes including styling and design elements that help define the brand image). The logo and wireframes can be completed independently without referencing each other; however, the user producing the mock-up has viewing privileges to both other parts in the design component as it is comprised of wireframes styled with the brand image.
  <br><br>
  Finally, the prototype component regards building the backend of the minimum viable product. This first part consists of planning the prototype; the flowchart and schema. The flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of the workflow and process by which a customer uses the product, and the schema consists of a simple plan of the database structure of the product’s backend. The second part, the prototype, is the product itself; the core features necessary to deploy the MVP, whose backend follows the schema and frontend follows the flowchart and resembles the mock-ups. It is worth the most amount of equity because it is the most time intensive part in the <b>build phase</b>, and the most valuable content being created.
  <br><br>
  A more detailed explanation of each part along with a recommended structure for the content being submitted is detailed below.

  How does one take control of the part? 
  <br><br>
  If you click on an idea from the build page, you will get to its idea build overview page. Here, you will see a list of the components along with their corresponding parts and equity percentages. Under the part name, you will see its status, which can be locked, unstarted, started, finished, in review or accepted. Next to the equities, you will see buttons that indicate whether or not you can take action, and what action you can take for the given part. When the buttons are blue, it means they are active and you can take action; these can be start or finish. When they are grey, it means you cannot take action. These can be locked, started, finished or in review. 
  <br><br>
  A locked status and button indicate that other parts must be completed before this part can be started. For example, the idea description must be concluded before any other part can be started. When the status is unstarted and the button is blue and says start, it means you can take control of the part and submit content in exchange for equity. You must press start to be able to click on the part name and start working on your content. This content’s type varies depending on the part under consideration; for example, the prototype part’s content is code pushed from your development environment at home to a repository on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>.
  <br><br>
  Below is a table that depicts the type of content submitted for each part, what other parts must be submitted before the part can be unlocked.

  <i><b>*</b>The prototype user will also have viewing access to all of the design component parts, but they need not be completed before he/her starts building it since matching the prototype to the frontend design can happen at any point in the development process.</i>
  <br><br>
  The <i>other parts required for unlock</i> column in the table above also represents the parts that the user building a given part has viewing access for (e.g. the idea description part must be completed before all other parts, and thus all subsequent part users will have viewing access to the plan component). 
  <br><br>
  Hence for a given part, once the parts required for it to be built are completed, it becomes unlocked. You can then start the part and submit your content at your own pace. 
  <hr>
</div>

<div>
<a class='anchor' id='unstartpart'></a>
  <h4><strong>Unstarting a Part</strong></h4><br>
  If you feel as though you should not have started a part, whether its because you will not have the time to complete it or because you do not feel like you will be able to submit content of the appropriate quality, you can unstart the part from the part’s edit page. If you choose to do so, <b>you will not gain any equity, even if you have written a portion of it already</b>, and you will <b>lose reputation</b> (the exact amount of which is explained below).  
  <hr>
</div>

<div>
<a class='anchor' id='finishpart'></a>
  <h4><strong>Finishing a Part and Assessment of Contribution Quality</strong></h4><br>

  Once you have finished submitting the content and think you have a final version, you return to the idea build overview page to press the blue button finish. The majority of your work is now completed, but you will still have small edits to make for your work to be accepted and for you to gain the equity. 
  <br><br>
  The status and button of the part will then change to in review; now, members of the labthi.ng team will look through your content and assess its quality. If they have small suggestions regarding how it can be brought to a higher standard, they can leave tasks on the edit page for you to complete during this period.
  <br><br>
  <b>Tasks</b>
  <br><br>
  During the review stage, the team will scrutinise your work and leave you small tasks to help improve your contribution standard to a point where others will want to remunerate you for your content in the buy phase. Tasks will have a very specific description of the problem, and what you should do to fix it; for example in the marketing strategy implementation, we could write “you have not quantified the costs and revenues for your banner ad marketing strategy idea – please try and estimate its cost, the number of users it will reach, and the consequent revenue it will bring to the business; try and justify your numbers with facts about the customer segment”. 
  <br><br>
  Next to a given task, there will be a blue button identical to that on the idea build page next to a part that will say start and finish. You should press start before you make changes, finish your edits, and then press finish. When you finish a task, a moderator will revise it and either accept it or reject it. If he rejects it, the task button will revert to start and you will have to try to edit it again. If you have any questions about the task, or you feel as though it is not necessary or has not been explained properly you may also comment on the task itself, and a moderator will promptly reply. 
  <br><br>
  If you do not want to complete the tasks, the labthi.ng team will reject your content submission and you will not gain equity in the idea, and the part’s status will revert to unstarted. Although this may seem harsh, if you submit content of high quality, there will be few to no tasks assigned to you; we have implemented this policy to help you submit the best content possible.
  <br><br>
  Once you have completed all of your tasks and our team has accepted all of them, the status of the part will become accepted, and you will have gained an appropriate amount of equity and reputation points!
  <hr>
</div>

<div>
<a class='anchor' id='measuringcontrbuild'></a>
  <h4><strong>Measuring Contributions</strong></h4><br>

  Besides awarding you with equity, we award reputation points for each of the actions possible in the <b>build phase</b>. These are described in the table below.<br><br>
  <table class='table'>
    <tbody align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td ><b>User Action</b></td>
        <td ><p><b>Reputation Points</b></p></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td ><p>Start a part</p></td>
        <td ><p>10</p></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td ><p>Unstart a part</p></td>
        <td ><p>-20</p></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td ><p>Start a task</p></td>
        <td ><p>1</p></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td ><p>Task accepted</p></td>
        <td ><p>4</p></td>
      </tr>

      <tr> 
        <td></td>
        <td></td>      
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <i><b>*</b>The equity percentage number without the percentage times 10. For example, the amount of reputation points a user gains from the prototype part being accepted is 0.30 x 1000 = 300 points.</i>
  <br><br>
  The decision to revoke reputation points if you unstart a part is not to discourage you taking charge of submitting the content, but merely to encourage you to think thoroughly about whether you can submit work of the appropriate quality standard and whether you have the time to complete your contribution.

  <h4><strong>The Transition from Build to Buy</strong></h4>
  <br>
  Once all of the parts have been submitted and accepted, the idea has appropriately turned into a potential business and minimum viable product. It consists of a fully functioning prototype, a business plan including the next steps towards turning the product at this stage into its stage when it should be launched, and the marketing strategy associated with gaining customer interest through its future stages of development so that the product makes a big impact when it is released. Thus, it is now in the perfect condition for you—an experienced entrepreneur, an investor, or anyone with an eye for tech start-ups brimming with potential—to snap it up, finish its development, and launch it yourself.
