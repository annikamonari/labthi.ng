  Content ranges from descriptive to extremely detailed (e.g. the marketing strategy to get customers interested in a beta launch of the product; how will you get them interested, what the product will offer to them, and the benefits the company will gain from the customer interest generated. You will mainly be concerned with writing about what exactly the marketing strategy will entail and with building the brand image; what kinds of advertising, online sale structures and offline promotion and sale structures will be needed to effectively increase the amount of customers interested in the product, and to solidify the brand image in the minds of consumers. Consult the <i>unique value proposition</i> part of the <i>business model summary</i> in the <a href="/documentation#ideadescription" target="_blank">idea description</a> as a rough guideline for how you should build the brand image. The other marketing sections of the <i>business model summary</i> may be useful to you throughout this part. The word count of the content should be over 1000 words.

  <ul type="circle">
    <li><i>Advertising strategy:</i> outline how money will be spent in each medium and in what markets (e.g. frequency of email marketing, specific portals, size of banner ads).</li><br>
    <li>Include allocation of efforts: describe the percentage of time and resources spent on different types of online marketing and the components expected to generate the most new business.</li><br>
    <li>How will you reach your customers? How will you expand these channels as sales increase? It may be useful to use the <i>channels</i> part of the <a href="/documentation#ideadescription" target="_blank">idea description</a> here. </li><br>
    <li><i>Online sales: </i>what are the key features related to design, payment method, hosting arrangements that you must consider to enhance your company image, to present your product clearly, to enhance usability, and to eventually generate as much popularity as possible?</li><br>
    <li><i>Pricing policy when the product is launched: </i>what will be your strategy? What is the lowest price you can sell your product at, covering all costs, and the highest price that you think consumers are willing and able to pay? What is the ideal price to choose between these two points? Try and back these numbers with customer input and consultation, maybe one interview with an ideal customer in the targeted market.</li><br>
    <li><i>Competitive pricing position:</i> will it be greater than, equal to or less than competitor prices? Justify this decision by comparing your competitor’s business strategies and product specification to yours. If you’re appealing to more elite clientele than your competitors, your pricing may be independent. If your product is of higher quality, you may be justified in pricing it higher. Be sensitive to competitors’ deals, promotions and discounts when you think about pricing. </li><br>
    <li><i>Branding:</i> what do you want the brand image to be? What do current potential consumers think of your product brand, or see your brand as? Strong brands incorporate selling across multiple trade channels; even though it’s a technology related product that most people will use at their computers or mobile devices, marketing strategies that are offline are also important. Elucidate ways in which you can incorporate an offline marketing strategy to enhance customers’ accessibility and appreciation for your product. Focus on your company image, and the emotional connection you create between your brand and your consumers; that is what will establish a long-run, scalable and sustainable brand.</li><br>
    <li><i>Database marketing:</i> how can you modify your product and its sales channels to garner information about buying patterns, consumer reactions to aspects of the product, and consumer reaction to your brand at various stages between the prototype stage and launch to optimise your product and brand? Use data about their past behaviour to predict their future reactions to changes. Explain how you will use this at various beta stages before launch to develop your product as best as possible.</li><br>
    <li>Is affiliate marketing applicable? Could you link external services on the website to sell along with the product, to garner commission on their sales generated from your website?  E.g. Amazon affiliates can earn 15% for linking Amazon products to their website. </li><br>
    <li>Could reciprocal marketing be applicable – e.g. one company offering a discount on another company’s products.</li><br>
    <li><i>Viral marketing:</i> can you offer or produce something so intriguing that people spread the word on their own? How could you incorporate this into your product or into your market strategy? E.g. an entertaining, engaging video associated with the product including your company’s insignia.</li><br>
    <li><i>Advertising:</i> banner ads are a traditional and effective advertising method for enhancing brand strength, despite having a click rate of less than 5%; multimedia animated banners have a 3-5x better click rate. Would you use these tactics? Where? How would you design these to effectively push your brand image?  These banners are also effective on mobile platforms, especially if the application if a mobile app; how will you change your Internet banners to adapt to a mobile setting? How much attention do you expect to generate from these advertising methods? </li><br>
    <li>Portals are also effective for advertising; can use Yahoo and other sites (e.g. iVillage, Facebook, Women.com) to target your customer segment. Are these relevant? If so how will you use them effectively, and what kind of results do you expect to see when using them?</li><br>
    <li><i>Sponsorships: </i>are there other start-ups or companies that could benefit from association with your product?  How and why? What benefits would it bring you? Try and outline the costs and benefits associated with such sponsorships, if they are possible. </li><br>
    <li><i>Other online marketing strategies:</i> can you incorporate chat rooms and other feedback mechanisms to enable customers to have a say in the direction of the product? Would the product benefit from having any open source component? Can you offer extended services after a customer has purchased the product to answer questions they may have, or to fix bugs they encounter? How will this then help the returning customer base of the product?</li><br>
    <li><i>Attention from media:</i> are there any online news sources (e.g. TechCrunch) and blogs that directly target your customer segment, that you could seek press coverage from? Who would you target and what kind of attention/benefits would their features bring you?</li><br>
    <li>Are there any events (e.g. Hackathons, conferences) where you could promote your product by involving it or involving the team behind it? How so and what benefits would this bring?</li><br>
    <li><i>Implementation of the marketing strategy:</i> what are the in-house responsibilities for this marketing strategy’s implementation? Can you see a requirement of external public relations or advertising companies to help implement your strategy? What benefits would this bring, and what are the costs associated with doing so? Pay for advertising companies is generally a small percentage of advertising revenue. </li><br>
    <li>How will you determine which revenue streams (e.g. from different types of advertising) are generating the most traffic, and what will you do with this data?</li>
